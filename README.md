# Test of Faith Redemption

Hi! This is our latest game made!


It's a simple dungeon prototype where you need to kill all the enemies and encounter the final boss while finding stronger cards and making your deck bigger. 

It's still on the prototype phase, so beware of the bugs and some issues with the game mechanics. Don't worry! We'll fix them as we get through those

Hope you enjoy!
